# OpenForensics
OpenForensics is an open-source OpenCL Digital Forensics analysis and file carving tool. This prototype tool was built in conjunction with PhD research from Dr Ethan Bayne as a platform to demonstrate the performance enhancements possible when applying GPGPU processing and an optimised PFAC algorithm to the problem of string searching in the field of Digital Forensics. Details of the supporting research can be found in the completed thesis by Dr Ethan Bayne: https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/studentTheses/accelerating-digital-forensic-searching-through-gpgpu-parallel-pr

Further later enhancements to the processing framework can be found detailed within the paper presented at DFRWS 2018. You can read the proceedings published by Digital Investigation: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1742287618300379 

This prototype tool was built using C# and Cudafy.NET (https://cudafy.codeplex.com/). Currently, the file carving provided by this tool is considered basic (carves data between found header and footer). Whilst it is intended to develop more advanced file carving features in time, we would welcome collaborators to help build upon the functionality of the tool.

# Basic Usage
    1. (Optional) Provide a case reference and evidence reference.
    2. Select either a physical drive or a file to perform physical searching on.
    3. Select targets (either file-types or keywords).
    4. (Optional) Choose processing technique (GPU usage recommended).
    5. Click Analyse.
    6. Choose location to save results.

OpenForensics will create a set of sub-folders and files to store results. The directory and file hierarchy created is: 

    <save-location>

      └─ <case-reference> default:"OpenForensics Output"
 
        └─ <evidence-reference> default:file/drive name
            ├─ LogFile.txt
            ├─ CarvableFileData.of
            └─ <Folder of each file-type carved>
                └─ <Files carved>

If data exists for the case and file/storage device, an option will present itself to query whether you want to reproduce files using existing results. Selecting No will prompt whether you want to overwrite the existing results with a new search. Warning: Old results will be erased when proceeding.

File-types are populated from the FileTypes.xml file. OpenForensics will load the file-types specified in this file when the program launches. Each file-type specified in FileTypes.xml should have values for:

    1. Type -- (Image/Video/Audio/Document/Misc) -- used to categorise file types for batch searching.
    2. Name -- Used as a file identifier and also for file extension for carved files.
    3. Value -- File header in byte format without spaces (e.g. FFD8FFE00010).
    4. EOF (Optional) -- File footer in byte format without spaces (e.g. FFD9). Required for file carving.
    5. MaxLengthMB (Optional) -- Specifies the maximum file length for the type of file (Default: 10 MiB).
